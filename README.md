✨ Project Overview
This repository contains the source code for a custom, professionally-designed LinkedIn Cover Banner for Ayoub Rachidi, a Full-Stack Developer. The banner is crafted to be visually engaging, technologically focused, and optimized for LinkedIn's recommended dimensions (1584 x 396 pixels).

The design uses modern aesthetics, including a dark theme, a dynamic code-like background, and a prominent display of key technical skills to immediately convey the developer's expertise and professional focus.

🚀 Technologies and Tools
The banner is built purely using front-end web technologies to ensure maximum customizability, scalability, and quality.

HTML5: Structure and organization of content.

CSS3: Styling, animations, and responsive layout.

CSS Gradients & Filters: For a modern, deep-space aesthetic.

CSS Animations (@keyframes): Subtle floating effects for decorative elements.

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics): Used for all technology icons (Next.js, React, Tailwind, Prisma, MongoDB, Stripe) to ensure crisp, high-resolution visuals at any scale.

💡 Key Features
Optimized Dimensions: Precisely sized to LinkedIn's standard banner resolution (1584px x 396px).

Modern Aesthetic: Utilizes a sleek, dark-blue/grey color palette with vibrant blue accents (#3b82f6) inspired by modern developer tooling UIs.

Technology Showcase: Prominently features a dedicated row of key technology icons (SVG) and a clear text listing of the full stack.

Dynamic Background: Includes an animated, subtle grid overlay (.grid-bg) and a transparent code snippet (.code-pattern) to evoke a technical, high-tech feel.

Clear Callout: The developer's name, role, and a brief, impactful tagline are clearly visible and emphasized with modern typography.

Profile Integration: Features a dedicated, styled container for the LinkedIn profile icon, ensuring optimal placement and visual hierarchy.

🛠 Usage and Deployment
1. Setup
The project requires no special build tools. Simply clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/AYOU-pixel/Cover-LinkedIn
cd linkedin-banner
2. Customization
To use this banner for your own profile:

Update Content: Modify the name, role, and tech stack text within the .content section of the HTML.

Replace Icon: Update the image src inside the .profile-icon-container with your actual profile picture (ideally a placeholder or instructions to the final user).

Adjust Colors/Styles: Modify the variables in the <style> block to match your personal branding or preferred aesthetic.

3. Export and Upload
Rendering: As this is an HTML/CSS design, you will need to render it to an image file (PNG is recommended for quality).

Use a full-page screenshot tool, ensuring the viewport is exactly the banner's dimensions (1584px wide).

Alternatively, use a web-to-image API or service for a precise capture.

Upload: Upload the generated PNG/JPG file to the "Edit Profile Background" section on your LinkedIn profile.
